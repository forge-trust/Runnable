# RazorWire Runtime Contract Pipeline

RazorWire's first-party browser assets are authored in TypeScript and delivered through the same package paths that hosts already use. The package also carries an exact, byte-copied Turbo runtime under its own custody checks. Application code does not need to move RazorWire script URLs, globals, custom events, DOM hooks, CSS hooks, or island strategy names.

## Maintainer Quickstart

Install the shared web workspace once from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --dir Web install --frozen-lockfile
```

For a no-change freshness check, run:

```bash
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:typecheck
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:test
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:verify
```

For an edit-build-verify loop, update files under `Web/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/assets/src`, then run:

```bash
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:build
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:test
pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:verify
```

The root `assets:typecheck`, `assets:test`, `assets:build`, and `assets:verify` commands run both Docs and RazorWire asset pipelines.

## Source And Output Ownership

- `assets/src/razorwire.ts` is the authored source for the core runtime exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/razorwire.js`.
- `assets/src/razorwire.islands.ts` is the authored source for the island loader exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/razorwire.islands.js`.
- `assets/src/page-navigation.ts` is the authored source for the lazy page-navigation runtime exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/page-navigation.js`.
- `assets/src/section-copy.ts` is the authored source for the lazy section-copy runtime exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/section-copy.js`.
- `assets/src/form-interactions.ts` is the authored source for the lazy form-interactions runtime exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/form-interactions.js`.
- `assets/src/behavior-kit.ts` is the authored source for the eager native behavior-kit runtime exposed at `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/behavior-kit.js`.
- `wwwroot/razorwire/razorwire.js`, `wwwroot/razorwire/razorwire.islands.js`, `wwwroot/razorwire/page-navigation.js`, `wwwroot/razorwire/section-copy.js`, `wwwroot/razorwire/form-interactions.js`, and `wwwroot/razorwire/behavior-kit.js` are generated, minified, committed package outputs. Do not edit them by hand.
- `node_modules/@hotwired/turbo/dist/turbo.es2017-umd.js` from the exact `@hotwired/turbo` 8.0.23 dependency is the upstream source for `wwwroot/razorwire/turbo.es2017-umd.js`. The build verifies the package name, version, `main` entry, and approved SHA-256 digest before making a byte-for-byte copy. It is a copied third-party output, not an esbuild-generated first-party bundle; do not edit or re-minify it. The [Turbo 8.0.23 upgrade review](turbo-8.0.23-upgrade-review.md) records the upstream change range, risk dispositions, and browser evidence.
- `assets/contracts/razorwire-public-contracts.js` is a docs-only manifest for AppSurface Docs JavaScript API harvesting. It documents browser contracts without forcing the harvester to parse generated runtime bundles.
- `wwwroot/razorwire/exampleJsInterop.js` remains hand-authored, demo-only JavaScript. It is not part of the generated runtime pipeline.

The section-copy manager has two deliberately separate documentation boundaries: the manifest documents the consumer-facing singleton and a declaration-only `SectionCopyManager` object shape, while the TypeScript runtime keeps the implementation behind the exact `appsurface:source-marker` begin/end pair. See [Section Copy](section-copy.md#api-shape) for the public singleton contract and recovery workflow. The marker is a future harvesting anchor, not a generated bundle input or a permission to construct a second manager.

Generated outputs stay committed because Razor Class Library static web assets, embedded fallback resources, command-line hosts, and existing consumers depend on those physical paths.

## Public Contract

The TypeScript migration preserves the public browser surface:

- Script paths:
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/turbo.es2017-umd.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/razorwire.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/razorwire.islands.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/page-navigation.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/section-copy.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/form-interactions.js`
  - `/_content/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/razorwire/behavior-kit.js`
- Tag helper output: `<rw:scripts />`, `<rw:scripts behavior-kit="true" />`, the bundled or custom same-origin Turbo script selected by `RazorWireOptions.Turbo`, host-managed omission, and lazy/eager split-runtime detectors. Hosts that need a cross-origin URL, subresource integrity, or custom script attributes own the complete Turbo tag and its synchronous load order through `HostManaged` mode.
- Global state: `window.RazorWire`, `window.RazorWire.config`, `connectionManager`, `localTimeFormatter`, `formFailureManager`, `pageNavigationManager`, `sectionCopyManager`, `formInteractionsManager`, and `behaviors`.
- Section copy: consumers use the singleton `window.RazorWire.sectionCopyManager`; they call `scan()` after out-of-band DOM changes, use `prune()` for disconnected roots, and use `getDiagnostics()`/`clearDiagnostics()` for recovery. Do not construct `SectionCopyManager`.
- Form events: `razorwire:form:submit-start`, `razorwire:form:failure`, `razorwire:form:diagnostic`, and `razorwire:form:submit-end`.
- DOM hooks: `data-rw-*` form, island, page-navigation, and section-copy attributes, including generated failure UI and section-copy fallback markers.
- CSS hooks: RazorWire form failure variables, generated form error attributes, page-navigation state attributes, and section-copy state/fallback attributes.
- Island strategies: `load`, `idle`, `visible`, and `only`. Use `only` for client-only islands; `immediate` is intentionally not a public strategy name.

No consumer migration is required for hosts that use the first-party TypeScript asset pipeline through `<rw:scripts />` without a separate Turbo tag; the default now supplies the packaged same-origin runtime. Hosts retaining the former CDN tag must remove it or switch to `HostManaged` so Turbo is not loaded twice. See [Choose who supplies Turbo](../README.md#choose-who-supplies-turbo) before retaining a custom or host-owned script tag.

## Diagnostics

Asset diagnostics are one-line, grep-friendly messages with this shape:

```text
CODE Summary. Problem: what failed. Cause: likely reason. Fix: concrete repair. Docs: Web/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/Docs/runtime-contract-pipeline.md.
```

Current diagnostics:

- `RWASSET001`: Node.js could not start the asset verifier.
- `RWASSET002`: a generated asset exceeded its raw or gzip budget.
- `RWASSET003`: generated package outputs changed when rebuilt from `assets/src`.
- `RWASSET004`: the pinned Turbo package, declared UMD entry, approved digest, copy operation, or committed copied output failed custody verification.
- `RWPACK001`: `dotnet pack` refused to embed stale or unverifiable generated runtime assets.

## Pack Guard

`ForgeTrust.RazorWire.csproj` runs `pnpm --dir Web run assets:razorwire:verify` before `Pack`. This is intentionally pack-only: normal builds and tests do not require Node.js just to compile C#.

If a release is blocked by a confirmed infrastructure failure, use the emergency bypass:

```bash
dotnet pack Web/ForgeTrust.RazorWire/ForgeTrust.RazorWire.csproj /p:VerifyRazorWireGeneratedAssetsBeforePack=false
```

Treat that property as an incident escape hatch. Re-run the asset verifier and remove the bypass before publishing whenever possible.

## Pitfalls

- Do not commit TypeScript source changes without regenerated `wwwroot/razorwire/*.js` outputs.
- Do not edit, banner, minify, or otherwise transform `turbo.es2017-umd.js`; update its pinned dependency, digest, notice, and custody tests together when upgrading Turbo.
- Do not change public strategy taxonomy from `only` to `immediate`; existing docs and generated UI use `only`.
- Do not enable source maps by default. Package consumers should receive compact runtime assets without source-map sidecars.
- Do not move AppSurface Docs harvesting back to minified runtime outputs. Update `assets/contracts/razorwire-public-contracts.js` when the public JavaScript contract changes.
- Keep singleton contracts and implementation anchors aligned: update the manifest, the marker-focused Node tests, and [Section Copy](section-copy.md) together when the section-copy manager contract changes.
- Do not treat `exampleJsInterop.js` as a runtime source file. It exists for demos and examples only.
- Do not add app-specific classes, icons, or layout assumptions to generated section-copy buttons or fallback UI. Hosts should decorate stable `data-rw-section-copy*` hooks outside the package runtime.
