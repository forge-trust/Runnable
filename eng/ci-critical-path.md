# AppSurface CI Critical Path

This note is the CI-000 baseline for build-time work. It records the current PR decision path before coverage artifact changes or coverage-matrix experiments are judged by timing data.

## Current PR validation path

AppSurface currently runs these workflows for ordinary pull requests to `main`:

- `build.yml`: generated package chooser verification, Markdown snippet verification, web asset verification, solution tests with coverage, Codecov upload, and AppSurface Docs export.
- `package-gate.yml`: isolated NuGet restore, release package build, package manifest gate, and package packing.
- `package-artifacts.yml`: package artifact verification and upload.
- `code-quality.yml`: locked restore, release build, generated verification, and `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`.
- `release-contract.yml`: PR title and unreleased-entry contract.
- `release-prep.yml`: release-tooling or release-artifact review only for release-related paths.
- `vcs-ignore-parity.yml`: docs VCS ignore parity tests only for docs/package-lock related paths.

GitHub returned `Branch not protected` for `main` on 2026-06-02, so there is no GitHub-enforced required-check set at this snapshot. The trusted PR decision path is therefore the practical all-green convention across the workflows above, not a branch-protection rule.

## Baseline timing sample

Recent PR runs from 2026-06-02 showed this shape:

- `build.yml` was the long tail at roughly 9-10 minutes end to end when docs export was included; the old serialized `Run tests` step was roughly 6m13s to 6m20s.
- `package-gate.yml`, `package-artifacts.yml`, and `code-quality.yml` generally completed in about 2-4 minutes.
- `release-contract.yml`, `release-prep.yml`, and `vcs-ignore-parity.yml` were short checks when they ran, but they still contribute to the all-green moment.
- The docs export job repeated generated package chooser, Markdown snippet, and web asset verification after `build` already completed those checks, costing roughly 41-55 seconds in the sampled runs.

Future CI performance changes should compare:

- p50 and p95 time from push to all trusted PR checks green.
- `build.yml` total time and test lane time.
- Codecov coverage upload and test-result upload success.
- Total runner minutes, because matrix fan-out can trade wall-clock time for capacity.
- Stale-run cancellation behavior for superseded commits on the same PR branch.

## v1 policy

- Keep all current PR workflows active.
- Keep coverage as PR confidence unless a measured follow-up proves Codecov coverage and test-result reporting still work under a different policy.
- Use `concurrency.cancel-in-progress` on long PR workflows so superseded commits stop consuming runner capacity.
- Keep PR tests in a single coverage-bearing lane until a measured public-CLI matrix design proves it reduces total GitHub Actions minutes, not just wall-clock time.
- Preserve a single merged Cobertura output at `TestResults/coverage-merged/coverage.cobertura.xml` for Codecov and local contributors.

## NuGet cache policy

Issue #479 treats NuGet package caching as a measured CI hygiene change, not as the primary fix for the solution coverage long pole. Caching is enabled only for jobs that repeatedly restore the shared locked dependency graph:

- `build.yml` / `build`
- `build.yml` / `export-appsurface-docs`
- `code-quality.yml` / `dotnet-format`

Each cache-enabled job sets `NUGET_PACKAGES: ${{ github.workspace }}/.nuget/packages` at the job level before `actions/setup-dotnet`, then uses `setup-dotnet` with `cache: true` and cache dependency paths for both `**/packages.lock.json` and `**/packages.*.lock.json`. The broad lock-file paths are intentional for this first rollout because the selected solution-shaped jobs restore project graphs spread across the repository, including RID-specific AppHost lock files. A dependency or lock-file change anywhere in that graph can invalidate the cache; that is expected and safer than silently omitting a restored project from the cache key. If future timing data shows lock-file churn dominates cache misses, split the cache dependency paths by job/project scope in a follow-up.

Cache-enabled build jobs should restore explicitly before later .NET commands. When `build.yml` runs `scripts/coverage-solution.sh` after that restore, it sets `BUILD_NO_RESTORE=true` so the public CLI's solution build does not hide additional restore work inside the coverage timing. The default script then runs the aggregate coverage gate itself; pull-request jobs set `COVERAGE_GATE_DIFF_BASE=HEAD^1` so the patch gate uses the synthetic merge checkout, while baseline jobs set the variable empty to omit patch thresholds.

Package-sensitive workflows stay uncached unless a separate issue evaluates their trust boundary. In particular, `package-gate.yml` must keep its isolated `${{ runner.temp }}/nuget-packages` restore and `NuGet.package-gate.config` source policy. Publish, smoke-restore, trusted-publishing, and package validation workflows should not inherit the shared NuGet cache by convention.

## Tailwind host-scoped CLI in CI

The main Tailwind package has no native runtime-package dependency. A normal build
resolves exactly one standalone CLI for the machine running MSBuild and stores it in a
verified, version/RID-scoped cache. Do not set a consumer RuntimeIdentifier to select
the CLI: it describes the application target, not the build host.

| Workflow/job | Required Tailwind posture |
| --- | --- |
| `build.yml` / ordinary build | Leave Tailwind enabled when generated CSS is part of the project; it uses the host cache. |
| `build.yml` / coverage-security-platform | Keep `TailwindEnabled=false` because the test intentionally avoids generated CSS. Do not use the removed runtime-resolution switch. |
| `vcs-ignore-parity.yml` / compatibility smoke | The direct companion package may be built independently, but it is not evidence for the main-package consumer graph. |
| `package-gate.yml` and package artifacts | Keep the isolated NuGet cache; `verify-packages` inspects the main archive and runs the real packed-consumer proof. |
| `tailwind-native-host-evidence.yml` | Runs the exact five-host matrix with repository-configured protected runners and emits an aggregate, tag-bound evidence artifact. |
| release publishing | Require `verify-packages`, manifest byte-identity proof, packed-consumer proof, and the complete five-host evidence set. |

For a durable CI cache, restore the Tailwind cache before `dotnet build` and key it by
the manifest version and actual native host, for example
`appsurface-tailwind-4.1.18-linux-x64`. A fresh offline cache must fail before process
start; a prewarmed verified entry succeeds without network access. An explicit
`TailwindCliPath` is the documented alternative for air-gapped or custom-tool jobs.

The supported-native evidence set is Linux x64, Linux Arm64, macOS x64, macOS Arm64,
and Windows x64. Windows Arm64 uses the Windows x64 asset under emulation. CI may not
claim five-host coverage from a cross-RID run. If a hosted runner is unavailable for a
RID, use a trusted native self-hosted runner and persist the archive, nuspec, assets
file, restore binlog, cache identity, and output listing as release evidence.

For release proof, prefer the package artifact workflow over hand-packing:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  verify-packages \
  --package-version 0.0.0-ci.local \
  --artifacts-output artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --report artifacts/package-validation-report.md
```

Publishing calls `tailwind-native-host-evidence.yml` directly and cannot reach the
NuGet job until its aggregate evidence validates one successful packed consumer for
each of `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`, and `win-x64`. Configure
the repository variable `TAILWIND_NATIVE_HOST_RUNNERS` before enabling that gate. It
must be a JSON object whose values are protected runner-label arrays, for example:

```json
{
  "linux-x64": ["self-hosted", "appsurface-tailwind-linux-x64"],
  "linux-arm64": ["self-hosted", "appsurface-tailwind-linux-arm64"],
  "osx-x64": ["self-hosted", "appsurface-tailwind-osx-x64"],
  "osx-arm64": ["self-hosted", "appsurface-tailwind-osx-arm64"],
  "win-x64": ["self-hosted", "appsurface-tailwind-win-x64"]
}
```

The gate fails closed when the variable is missing, a runner is unavailable, a host
reports a different RID, or a record cannot be bound to the exact tag commit, package
version, and release-manifest digest. Do not substitute cross-RID execution or reuse a
successful artifact from an earlier workflow run.

Every selected native runner must provide Bash, `jq`, and either `sha256sum` or
`shasum`. Treat a missing prerequisite as a host-configuration failure and install the
tool before enabling the runner label in `TAILWIND_NATIVE_HOST_RUNNERS`.

Cache misses are normal after dependency updates, lock-file updates, or cache eviction. The cache is only useful if warm runs reduce selected workflow time or runner minutes without regressing the all-green decision path. For cache experiments, record at least:

| Run | Cache state | Setup .NET | Locked restore | Build/tests/docs | Workflow total | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Baseline after #476 | none | | | | | |
| First #479 run | miss/populate | | | | | |
| Warm #479 run | hit | | | | | |

Use the GitHub UI for action step duration and the job summary for cache-hit, package path, package folder size, and locked restore duration. Merge cache changes only when warm-cache evidence shows at least a 30 second net improvement in one selected workflow or at least a 5% total runner-minute/all-green improvement without regression. If the threshold is not met, remove the cache workflow changes and keep only the measurement notes.

Common restore failures:

- A locked restore failure usually means package references, central package versions, or RID-specific AppHost inputs changed without updating `packages.lock.json` or `packages.*.lock.json`. Run `dotnet restore --force-evaluate`, commit the updated lock files, and rerun CI.
- `NU1403` after enabling setup-dotnet caching can happen because the action restores only the global packages folder. If CI hits this, add or test `DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder` centrally before widening the cache rollout.

Rollback is per job: remove `cache: true`, remove `cache-dependency-path`, and remove job-level `NUGET_PACKAGES` from the affected cache-enabled job. Leave package-gate's isolated temp `NUGET_PACKAGES` in place.
