# Release contract maintainer notes

This file lives under `.github/` on purpose so AppSurface Docs does not publish it as public documentation.

## `no-unreleased-entry` label

Use `no-unreleased-entry` only when a pull request does not belong in the public release story, such as:

- repository administration
- workflow-only cleanup
- maintainer ergonomics that do not affect adopters

Do not use it for package behavior, CLI behavior, examples, docs-facing behavior, or release policy changes.

## Deferred automation

The current workflow establishes the contracts that future release automation will consume:

- Conventional Commits PR titles
- one public unreleased proof artifact
- tagged release notes plus a compact changelog
- verified `.nupkg` artifacts from the manifest-backed package artifact workflow
- publishable .NET tool artifacts such as `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli`

CLI docs that show `dnx`, `dotnet tool execute`, or `dotnet tool install` assume
either a NuGet-published package or an explicit local package source.
`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli` is the public `appsurface` tool; RazorWire-specific
export workflows remain deferred to the separate `razorwire` tool.

Tracked follow-up: #161, "Automate coordinated monorepo releases from the public release contract".

## Release evidence bundle

Release preparation produces `releases/v{version}.evidence.json`, the release evidence bundle. This is repository release-artifact consistency evidence: it ties the release note, sidecar, release JSON, package release-note paths, optional docs archive catalog fields, and commit identity together for release-prep review and publish-time tag validation.

The release evidence bundle is not a GitHub artifact attestation. Keep `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` out of default release workflows unless an explicit future attestation mode is implemented and reviewed.

## Release-prep review boundary

Release preparation pull requests must include the four generated artifacts for
the prepared version: release note, sidecar, release manifest, and release
evidence bundle. They may also update an older generated release sidecar only
when carrying `redirect_aliases` forward to the new canonical release-candidate
note. Do not use that sidecar allowance for content edits, trust-bar edits, or
manifest/evidence rewrites from older releases.

## Release-prep bot authentication

The trusted `workflow_dispatch` job in
[`release-prep.yml`](./workflows/release-prep.yml) runs only when dispatched
from the protected `main` branch. Always select `main` as the dispatch ref,
even when preparing a maintained release branch. The `base-ref` input accepts
only `main` or a maintained `release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>` branch. Protect
those branches before enabling Release Prep: they are the trusted source of
the release tooling the workflow executes. The first job uses a read-only
`GITHUB_TOKEN` only to check out and fetch that base, without persisting
credentials. It prepares the release commit, bundle, and report, then uploads
those files as the `release-prep` artifact. Before it runs base-ref-controlled
release tooling, it verifies that the checkout is the current tip of the
selected base. That job never receives the organization-owned
`appsurface-release-bot` GitHub App credentials.

After that job succeeds, a separate fresh runner downloads only the bundle and
report. It does not check out or execute files from `base-ref`; before it reads
the App credentials, it fetches the selected protected base itself using its
read-only workflow token, requires the bundled release commit and manifest to
match that current base, rejects every changed path outside the
release-preparation allowlist, and requires every added or modified artifact to
be an ordinary Git file rather than a symlink or gitlink. Only then does it mint
a short-lived installation token to verify and fetch an existing
`release-bot/v<version>` branch, push the validated branch, and create or update
its release-preparation pull request. Before it updates that branch, it refuses
to overwrite a same-version branch that already backs an open pull request to a
different base. It does not use a personal access token.
This runner boundary prevents base-ref-controlled release tooling from
persisting command or environment state until the write token is present, and
prevents the token-bearing job from publishing arbitrary changes supplied by the
artifact. Using a GitHub App token for the write step also avoids the downstream
workflow behavior of pull requests created with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The generated `release-bot/v<version>` branch namespace is intentionally
separate from release source branches. A `release/*` branch-protection rule can
therefore protect maintained `release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>` bases without
matching the bot's pull-request branches. Keep the bot namespace unprotected
unless a later policy explicitly allows `appsurface-release-bot` to create and
update those branches; the pull request still targets a protected base branch.

Create the GitHub Actions environment named `release-prep` before enabling the
workflow. Set its **Deployment branches and tags** policy to **Selected
branches and tags** with the exact branch pattern `main`, and leave tags
disallowed. The separate token-publishing job sets `deployment: false`, so this
boundary protects the secret without adding deployment-history noise. Do not use
**Protected branches only** as a substitute: GitHub permits every branch when no
branch-protection rule exists. The environment rule is also what prevents an
API-dispatched workflow from another branch from reading the private key, even
if that branch changes its workflow file.

Install the App on **only** `forge-trust/AppSurface` with repository
permissions **Contents: read and write** and **Pull requests: read and write**.
Leave webhooks, user authorization, every organization permission, and every
other repository permission disabled. Do not grant a branch-protection bypass
for the bot namespace; the App should propose changes through pull requests,
not push directly to protected release sources.

Configure the App credentials before dispatching Release Prep:

- **Repository secret** `RELEASE_BOT_APP_CLIENT_ID`: the App's Client ID. This
  is an identifier, but it is intentionally stored as a secret so the workflow
  has one credential configuration boundary.
- **`release-prep` environment secret** `RELEASE_BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: the
  entire downloaded App private-key PEM, including its `BEGIN` and `END`
  lines. Move the key out of any repository or organization secret with this
  name before enabling the workflow; do not leave a duplicate outside the
  protected environment.

An organization secret is acceptable for `RELEASE_BOT_APP_CLIENT_ID` only when
its repository access list explicitly includes `forge-trust/AppSurface`. Do not
store the private key as an organization or repository secret. The workflow
validates both values without printing either, uses the pinned
[`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token)
action to mint the installation token, and revokes that token at the end of the
job. Rotate the private key by adding a replacement key, updating the repository
environment secret, proving one successful Release Prep run, and only then
deleting the old key in the GitHub App settings.

## Package artifact dry run

The pack-only release slice uses `packages/package-index.yml` as the single package
contract. Maintain `publish_decision`, `publish_reason`, and
`expected_dependency_package_ids` there instead of creating a second release package
list. Review [`packages/readiness.md`](../packages/readiness.md) before release
review when deciding whether package-index evidence is complete enough for the
package artifact workflow. That dashboard is generated maintainer evidence from
the package index, not live NuGet publish, artifact, or smoke-install status.

Run the package artifact verifier with an exact stable or prerelease version:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  verify-packages \
  --package-version 0.0.0-ci.local \
  --artifacts-output artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --report artifacts/package-validation-report.md
```

The verifier restores and builds the solution once, packs manifest-selected packages
with `--no-restore --no-build`, inspects each `.nupkg`, and writes a markdown report.
It checks package metadata, expected same-version dependencies, first-party DLL
informational versions, .NET tool command settings, Tailwind main-package manifest
assets, and direct companion runtime binary payloads. It accepts stable and prerelease SemVer identities, and intentionally
rejects SemVer build metadata because NuGet strips build metadata from package
identity.

`verify-packages` is the primary package-proof path for the Tailwind delivery boundary.
It proves the main package contains its targets, task, notices, and pinned
`build/tailwind.release.json` while containing no native Tailwind runtime payload or
runtime-companion dependency. Retained direct companion packages are validated
separately for their intentional native payloads. Restore and build normally; the
obsolete `TailwindRuntimeBinaryResolutionEnabled` switch is not part of main-package
release validation. The workflow also runs
[`verify-tailwind-package-consumer.sh`](../scripts/verify-tailwind-package-consumer.sh)
against the freshly packed main package, proving default host-cache acquisition,
generated CSS, no companion restore edge, and no copied native executable in consumer
output. Both NuGet publication workflows call the reusable
[`tailwind-native-host-evidence.yml`](./workflows/tailwind-native-host-evidence.yml)
gate, which fails closed unless five actual configured hosts return tag-bound evidence
for the exact package version and Tailwind manifest. Repository administrators must
configure the protected `TAILWIND_NATIVE_HOST_RUNNERS` JSON variable described in the
[CI critical path](../eng/ci-critical-path.md#tailwind-host-scoped-cli-in-ci);
an unavailable host is a release failure, not a skipped proof or a cross-RID substitute.

Stable publishing is intentionally separate from prerelease publishing so the
environment protections, trusted-publishing policy, and smoke-install proof stay
auditable for the public stable line.

## Protected NuGet stable publish

The stable publish slice lives in `.github/workflows/nuget-stable-publish.yml`.
It has no `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, or `workflow_dispatch` entry
point. It runs only when the main repository receives an annotated stable tag
that matches:

```text
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

On main, the stable workflow treats `main` as the source base. It force-fetches
the exact remote tag ref, resolves annotated tags to the tagged commit with
`refs/tags/<tag>^{commit}`, verifies that commit is reachable from
`origin/main`, and then checks that `build.yml` and `package-gate.yml` have
successful completed runs for that exact commit on `main` before any protected
publish job can start. Maintained release branches should backport the workflow
and set `STABLE_BASE_REF` to that release branch, such as `release/0.1.0`.

Before creating the stable tag, create the GitHub environments used by the
workflow. Create `nuget-stable` with required reviewers and prevent self-review
enabled. Create `nuget-stable-smoke` with a 25-minute wait timer and no required
reviewers so NuGet validation and indexing can settle before the smoke-install
runner starts. Add `NUGET_USER` as an environment or repository variable
containing the nuget.org profile name, not an email address. On nuget.org, add a
Trusted Publishing policy for the package owner with these GitHub Actions
details:

- Repository Owner: `forge-trust`
- Repository: `AppSurface`
- Workflow File: `nuget-stable-publish.yml`
- Environment: `nuget-stable`

NuGet's policy UI expects only the workflow file name, not the
`.github/workflows/` path. Keep the policy environment-scoped so a token
exchange is valid only after the GitHub environment approval gate has passed.
The workflow fails closed if `nuget-stable` is missing, has no required-reviewer
protection, or does not prevent self-review. It also fails closed if
`nuget-stable-smoke` is missing, lacks the 25-minute wait timer, or has required
reviewers configured.

Stable package proof uses the same artifact validation and smoke-install
contract as prerelease publishing, but with stable package identity:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  verify-packages \
  --package-version 0.1.0 \
  --artifacts-output artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --report artifacts/packages/package-validation-report.md
```

The protected publish job downloads that exact artifact bundle and runs:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  publish-stable \
  --artifacts-input artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --publish-log artifacts/packages/package-publish-log.md
```

Stable package versions are immutable once any package has been accepted by
NuGet. For transient NuGet or environment failures, re-run the failed workflow
with the same tag and package version; already published packages should become
`duplicate-reported`. For content or metadata defects after any stable package
is accepted, do not retag `v0.1.0`; fix forward with a new stable patch version.
Only dispatch `release-publish.yml` after `nuget-stable-publish.yml` has
published and smoke-installed successfully. For maintained release-branch
publishing, dispatch GitHub Release creation with the matching release branch as
`base-ref`, such as `release/0.1.0`.

## Protected NuGet prerelease publish

The prerelease publish slice lives in `.github/workflows/nuget-prerelease-publish.yml`.
It has no `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, or `workflow_dispatch` entry point.
It runs only when the main repository receives an annotated prerelease tag that
matches:

```text
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<preview|alpha|beta|rc>.<positive-number>
```

Examples: `v0.4.0-preview.1`, `v0.4.0-rc.2`.

The workflow force-fetches the exact remote tag ref before validation, resolves
annotated tags to the tagged commit with `refs/tags/<tag>^{commit}`, verifies that
commit is reachable from `origin/main`, and then checks that `build.yml` and
`package-gate.yml` have successful completed runs for that exact commit before any
protected publish job can start.

Publishing is gated by the GitHub Environment named `nuget-prerelease` and by a
nuget.org Trusted Publishing policy. The publish job requests a short-lived NuGet
API key through GitHub Actions OIDC immediately before it runs
`publish-prerelease`; do not create or store a long-lived `NUGET_API_KEY` secret
at the repository, organization, or environment level.

Before creating the first prerelease tag, create the GitHub environments used by
the workflow. Create `nuget-prerelease` with required reviewers and prevent
self-review enabled. Create `nuget-prerelease-smoke` with a 25-minute wait timer
and no required reviewers so NuGet validation and indexing can settle before the
smoke-install runner starts. Add `NUGET_USER` as an environment or repository
variable containing the nuget.org profile name, not an email address. On
nuget.org, add a Trusted Publishing policy for the package owner with these
GitHub Actions details:

- Repository Owner: `forge-trust`
- Repository: `AppSurface`
- Workflow File: `nuget-prerelease-publish.yml`
- Environment: `nuget-prerelease`

NuGet's policy UI expects only the workflow file name, not the
`.github/workflows/` path. Keep the policy environment-scoped so a token exchange
is valid only after the GitHub environment approval gate has passed. The workflow
fails closed if `nuget-prerelease` is missing, has no required-reviewer
protection, or does not prevent self-review. It also fails closed if
`nuget-prerelease-smoke` is missing, lacks the 25-minute wait timer, or has
required reviewers configured.

The PackageIndex tool owns the package contract for the workflow:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  verify
```

`verify` confirms both the adopter-facing package chooser and the maintainer
readiness dashboard are current. The readiness dashboard checks package-index
evidence such as release metadata, docs links, packability, tool command shape,
and expected first-party package dependencies before publish artifacts are built.

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  verify-packages \
  --package-version 0.4.0-preview.1 \
  --artifacts-output artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --report artifacts/packages/package-validation-report.md
```

`verify-packages` writes both the markdown validation report and
`package-artifact-manifest.json`. The JSON manifest records the package version,
manifest order, package id, project path, publish decision, artifact file name, tool
flag, declared tool command name for .NET tools, and SHA-512 hash for every
`publish` and `support_publish` package selected from `packages/package-index.yml`.
The `tool_command_name` value must be one file-name-safe command token, not a
path: no whitespace, path separators, reserved `.`/`..` segments, control
characters, trailing periods, Windows reserved device names or dotted aliases,
or Windows-invalid file-name characters.

The protected publish job downloads that exact artifact bundle and runs:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex.csproj -- \
  publish-prerelease \
  --artifacts-input artifacts/packages \
  --artifact-manifest artifacts/packages/package-artifact-manifest.json \
  --publish-log artifacts/packages/package-publish-log.md
```

`publish-prerelease` re-reads `packages/package-index.yml`, verifies that the JSON
artifact manifest exactly matches the current package plan and SHA-512 hashes, then
runs `dotnet nuget push --skip-duplicate` in manifest order. Captured publish
output is redacted before it is written to the uploaded ledger artifact, and the
ledger is rewritten after every package attempt so partial-publish evidence survives
later command failures. The publish ledger uses these statuses:

- `pushed`: NuGet accepted the package.
- `duplicate-reported`: `--skip-duplicate` reported that the package already exists.
- `failed`: the package push failed.
- `skipped-after-failure`: the package was not attempted because an earlier package
  failed.

Partial publish recovery uses the same tag and the same package version. Re-run the
failed workflow after fixing transient NuGet or environment problems. Already
published packages should become `duplicate-reported`, and the first package that
previously failed should be the first new `pushed` entry. Do not retag or create a
new package version for a transient partial publish.

Content or metadata defects require a new prerelease version. Once any package has
been accepted by NuGet, treat the entire coordinated package version as immutable.
Fix the defect in source, create the next prerelease tag, and let the workflow
publish the next package family.

After publishing, the workflow runs `smoke-install` from a fresh NuGet configuration
that clears inherited sources and points only at nuget.org. It restores all direct
non-tool `publish` packages from `packages/package-index.yml` in one aggregate
smoke project with a shared fresh `NUGET_PACKAGES` directory, isolated
`DOTNET_CLI_HOME`, and retry/backoff for NuGet indexing delay. This keeps the
post-publish check representative of user installs without multiplying restore
timeouts by the number of public library packages. Tool packages install with
`dotnet tool install --tool-path`, then the workflow resolves the declared
`tool_command_name` shim and runs `<command> --help`. The smoke job references
the `nuget-prerelease-smoke` environment, which must keep a 25-minute wait timer
so NuGet can finish validation and indexing before the runner starts. The job
sets a 70-minute timeout so the 25-minute environment wait still leaves up to
45 minutes for active smoke install work. The
smoke step fails if the installed command exits non-zero or if help output does
not identify the command users are expected to type.
