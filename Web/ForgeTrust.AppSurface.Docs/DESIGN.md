# AppSurface Docs Design Language

## Purpose

AppSurface Docs should feel like a focused documentation workspace, not a marketing site and not a generic SaaS dashboard. The UI should help people orient quickly, scan densely, and move deeper into docs with very little friction.

## Core Tone

- Quietly technical
- Editorial rather than card-heavy
- Dense, but never cramped
- Confident without looking flashy

If a new surface starts to feel like a feature grid, a landing page, or an AI-generated admin template, pull it back.

## Visual System

### Typography

- Primary typeface: `Inter`, with the platform sans-serif stack as fallback
- Body copy should stay clean and readable with generous line-height
- Authored Markdown prose should use a shorter measure and stronger paragraph/list rhythm than generated API reference pages. Release notes and long guides must scan as editorial documents, not as one uninterrupted text column.
- Headings should feel compact and intentional, not oversized hero copy
- Search results should privilege readable title hierarchy over decorative framing

### Color

- Base surfaces: deep navy, anchored by `#0D182A`
- Accent system: cobalt blue for primary controls, teal for active/focus states, and violet for occasional brand depth
- Borders and separators should do most of the structure work
- Avoid adding extra accent colors unless the feature truly needs semantic differentiation

### Brand

The package wordmark is plain text by default and must stay inside the sidebar/header bounds with ellipsis clipping for long display names. Product-specific wordmark color is opt-in through `AppSurfaceDocs:Identity:Wordmark`, which sets `--docs-brand-wordmark-highlight-color` only for the configured publish. AppSurface's public docs configure the shorter `DisplayName=AppSurface`, `HighlightText=Surface`, and `HighlightColor=#3B82F6` in the Pages export.

Do not use page-title gradients, teal, violet, or ad hoc Tailwind color utilities for the wordmark. `--docs-brand-blue` (`#2563EB`) remains the cobalt product/control accent, but it is too low-contrast for normal-size wordmark text on raised navy surfaces such as `#0D182A`. The wordmark blue `#3B82F6` clears WCAG AA for normal text on the docs navy surfaces, including `#0D182A`.

The layered AppSurface mark uses the same brand family: navy base (`#0D182A`), cobalt (`#2563EB`), teal (`#14B8A6`), violet (`#8B5CF6`), and ice (`#E5E7EB`). Keep the mark glow on the icon, not the text; the text wordmark may use a subtle dark edge shadow for crispness over dark or glowing backgrounds.

### Style Tokens

AppSurface Docs expresses the flagship dark-slate system through internal `--docs-*` CSS custom properties in `wwwroot/css/app.css`.

The token layer exists so contributors can preserve the same visual language without rediscovering which hardcoded navy, cobalt, teal, violet, or translucent fill belongs to each shared primitive. Token names should describe the design job: surface, border, text, accent, focus, active state, code chrome, table chrome, or skeleton. Do not name tokens after Tailwind hues unless the hue itself is the contract, which it usually is not.

Default rule:

1. If a color or treatment appears across unrelated shared selector groups, use or add a token.
2. If a color represents a repeated state such as focus, active, muted, raised, loading, or default border, use or add a token.
3. If a color is local to syntax highlighting, generated API signature colorization, or a one-off semantic badge family, keep it local and document the category.

These tokens are not a public theming API. Hosts should use the documented `AppSurfaceDocs:Theme` preset, bounded color-role, density, and chrome settings instead of overriding `--docs-*` names. Inside AppSurface Docs, shared package chrome and search-specific UI consume the same root token layer so built-in presets such as `AppSurfaceLight` can change the system deliberately while keeping that implementation detail private. Search CSS may route through `--docs-search-*` aliases with fallbacks because exact published release trees can serve `search.css` without the generated package stylesheet.

When a host uses a shared semantic pair such as Graphite through the [theme-pairs bridge](README.md#theme-pairs-migration), it may vary the rendered semantic colors without changing this editorial layout, information hierarchy, or Docs-owned `--docs-*` boundary. `GraphiteDark` and `AppSurfaceLight` remain separate fixed Docs-local presets rather than alternate layouts or shared-pair selectors. Use the [layout override boundary](README.md#default-razor-layout-and-deliberate-host-overrides) when a product needs control beyond the supported Docs theme roles.

### Surfaces

- Prefer layered panels, separators, and subtle fills over heavy boxed cards
- Result lists should read like an editorial index with strong rows, not isolated product cards
- Keep shadows minimal; contrast and spacing should carry the layout
- Homepage navigation rows should use the title and summary as the scan path. Use one quiet trailing chevron or icon affordance for depth, and do not repeat "Open..." labels across Start Here, featured pages, and secondary routes.

## Styling Boundary

AppSurface Docs uses multiple styling patterns because it is solving different ownership and stability problems.

Owned package chrome is local product UI. Harvested content is nested document output. Stateful search UI also needs selectors that both CSS and JavaScript can trust. Treating those surfaces as one blanket styling problem is how teams end up arguing about style purity instead of making the interface easier to maintain.

### Default Rule

Use this order when deciding where a new style belongs:

1. Reusable component contract or shared CSS and JavaScript hook: semantic class.
2. Unowned nested content rendered inside a package wrapper: wrapper-scoped semantic CSS.
3. One-off package chrome that AppSurface Docs owns directly: Tailwind utilities in markup.

`README.md` is the fast rulebook for this decision. This document explains why the rule exists and where contributors usually get tripped up.

### Why Ownership Beats Style Purity

- One-off owned chrome is easiest to read when the intent stays in the Razor markup that owns it.
- Harvested content is safest to style through a wrapper such as `.docs-content` because AppSurface Docs does not control each nested node or authoring shape.
- Markdown and generated API reference are both harvested content, but they are different reading jobs. Use `.docs-content--markdown` for prose rhythm and keep `.docs-content--api` on the wider base reference treatment.
- Reusable package components deserve semantic names even when AppSurface Docs owns the markup, because repeated UI contracts are easier to review and update when they have one stable selector.
- Search surfaces need semantic hooks because the stylesheet and `search-client.js` both rely on the same stable names across loading, empty, failure, and active-filter states.

### Edge Cases

#### Reusable owned package UI

Classes such as `docs-page-badge` and `docs-metadata-chip` are not a failure of utility-first styling. They are the right tool when a repeated package component needs one stable contract across multiple views and stylesheets.

Shared reusable primitives belong in the Tailwind entry stylesheet at `wwwroot/css/app.css`, which generates the package stylesheet loaded on every AppSurface Docs page. Search-specific state and result styling belongs in `wwwroot/docs/search.css`; do not make non-search pages depend on search assets for badges, metadata chips, or trust/provenance chrome. Generated JavaScript API lifecycle badges (`Public API`, `Alpha`, `Beta`, and `Deprecated`) are symbol-scoped shared primitives: use the shared lifecycle badge selector on rendered API fragments, and reuse the existing search-result badge component for their search chrome. Do not put a lifecycle badge on an aggregate API group page, because its symbols can have different maturity states.

#### Search workspace hooks

The search workspace renders semantic classes such as `docs-search-page`, `docs-search-page-filters-toggle`, and `docs-search-page-active-filters` directly in Razor, then extends those hooks in CSS and JavaScript. That is intentional. Shared hooks keep stateful UI readable and stable.

That does not mean every heading, paragraph, or fallback-link wrapper inside `Search.cshtml` needs its own semantic class. Keep the stateful container and interactive hook semantic, then use local utilities for one-off typography and spacing inside that single view.

JavaScript-rendered search result rows are a special case because the interactive surface is both styling hook and navigation contract. The row should contain one block-level `.docs-search-result-link` anchor that wraps the visible result content, so touch users can tap anywhere on the result while keyboard and assistive-technology users still get one normal link target. Because that anchor wraps rich row content, it should own a concise `aria-label` instead of letting breadcrumbs, paths, badges, and snippets become one long accessible name.

#### Required `id` values

Some search controls still need unique `id` values such as `docs-search-page-input` and `docs-search-page-filters-panel`. Those support uniqueness, accessibility relationships, and DOM targeting. They do not replace semantic classes as the reusable styling contract.

### Anti-Patterns

Avoid these by default:

- adding semantic classes to static package chrome when local utilities are clearer
- forcing repeated package UI back into long utility strings when a shared component class is already the simpler contract
- pushing utility classes into harvested nested HTML that AppSurface Docs does not fully own
- treating shared CSS and JavaScript hook classes as a failure of Tailwind instead of a legitimate integration seam
- moving styles across the boundary without a concrete user-facing benefit
- simulating whole-result search navigation with row click handlers when one semantic link can own the interaction

### Review Questions

When reviewing a change, ask:

- Does this surface need a reusable selector that more than one file depends on?
- Does AppSurface Docs fully own this markup, or is it styling nested harvested content?
- Will a future contributor understand where the style belongs without reading half the package?
- Is this change improving usability or maintainability, or just chasing stylistic consistency?

## Search Workspace

`/docs/search` is a search-first workspace.

- Keep the primary search input visually dominant
- Place filters directly under or adjacent to the query area
- Keep one main results stream, ranked by relevance
- Use badges and breadcrumbs to add context without fragmenting the scan path

### Starter State

The empty state should guide without feeling promotional.

- Include a one-sentence orientation
- Show clickable suggestion chips
- Explain that filters can also be used for browse mode before typing
- Show representative starter rows after the index loads so the page proves the corpus shape before the user knows the exact query
- Treat starter rows as discovery aids in the same single editorial stream, not as grouped dashboard columns
- Omit missing representative page types cleanly; do not render empty placeholders for Guide, API Reference, Example, Troubleshooting, or Release when the corpus lacks one

### Results

Results should be a high-information list.

- Title is the strongest element
- Breadcrumbs come first and stay subtle
- Badges are compact metadata, not visual decoration
- Snippets should stay short and readable
- Highlight matches with restrained `<mark>` styling
- Blank snippets should be omitted instead of replaced with filler text
- Page-type badges should use the shared badge vocabulary, including `Release` for release-note metadata aliases

### Filters

- Desktop: filters are visible within the page workspace
- Mobile: collapse filters behind a compact toggle with active-filter summary pills
- Disabled zero-result options should remain visible so the dataset shape stays legible

## State Design

Search has distinct states and they should look distinct.

- First load: show skeleton rows and clear “Loading search index...” messaging
- Refinement updates: keep prior results visible and use a subtle busy state
- No results: explain that the search worked, then offer recovery paths
- Failure: explain that search itself is unavailable, show retry, and provide fallback links

Do not reuse the no-results treatment for actual failures.

## Page-Local Navigation

`On this page` is a local map for the current document, not a second global navigation surface. The left sidebar owns the docs product hierarchy. The page outline owns the reader's position inside the current article.

Desktop details pages with an outline should use an article-first composition:

1. page title and current article content
2. quiet page-local outline rail
3. active section marker visible enough to scan without competing with reading

The persistent rail appears only on wide desktop (`>=1280px`) so the article column stays readable. Below that breakpoint, use one sticky collapsed `On this page` control above the article. Do not render separate desktop and mobile outlines.

Visual rules:

- Keep the rail editorial and quiet: border/separator structure beats boxed cards.
- Use teal for active and focus states only.
- Borrow the active-row treatment from the approved mockup direction: subtle row fill plus a teal marker.
- Keep H2 links stronger and H3 links quieter/indented.
- Use small row radii only. Do not wrap the whole rail in a large rounded card.
- Preserve the existing AppSurface Docs global sidebar; do not replace it with icon-only chrome for this pattern.
- On compact viewports, the collapsed outline may show previous, current, and next section context. The current section is dominant; previous and next stay smaller and quieter so the control remains a reader aid instead of a second header.
- When the compact outline is expanded, it is a bounded scroll surface with contained overscroll. Readers should be able to inspect a long `On this page` list without accidentally moving the article behind it.

Interaction rules:

- The active outline link uses `aria-current="location"`.
- Each outline row includes a small copy-link action that writes the absolute section URL to the clipboard without changing scroll position, browser history, or the current hash.
- Copy-link actions use conventional unframed copy iconography, remain visible without hover, and may highlight on hover or focus. Do not use `#` as the action glyph.
- Matching copy-link actions are added beside rendered Markdown headings and generated API type/member headers. Do not insert copy controls inside `summary`, signature blocks, `code`, `pre`, or source-link placeholders.
- Clipboard writes must run directly from the user's click or tap. If the browser denies clipboard access, show a focused manual-copy field and keep it open while focus remains inside the fallback.
- Turbo frame reloads must remove generated section-copy buttons, fallback popovers, status text, and timers before re-enhancing the new document.
- Mobile outline links collapse the outline after navigation so the reader returns to content.
- Compact context rows can use a subtle vertical rolling cue when the active section changes. Animate text rows only, keep the shell fixed-height, and disable the cue under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- JavaScript enhances server-rendered hash links. It must not create a hidden-only outline when scripts fail.

## Interaction Rules

- `/` focuses the visible search input when the user is not already typing
- `Cmd/Ctrl+K` opens the search workspace or focuses the advanced input
- Browser history should feel natural:
  - typing updates URL state with replace semantics
  - deliberate filter changes create navigable history entries
- Back/Forward must restore query, filters, and rendered results

## Accessibility

- Preserve semantic headings, labels, and live regions for status changes
- Loading, failure, and no-results states must remain understandable without visual context
- Focus should move predictably for shortcuts, retry, and suggestion chips
- Mobile layouts should keep search and results visible without forcing long filter scrolls

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these by default:

- chunky boxed result cards
- oversized marketing hero treatments
- decorative gradients inside core reading surfaces
- multiple competing result columns
- hiding the corpus shape behind over-minimal filter UI
- introducing visual styles that do not already fit the navy, cobalt, teal, and violet AppSurface system
