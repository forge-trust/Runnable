# Portable durable execution

AppSurface Durable is a public-preview package family for portable durable contracts. It is split by audience:

- [`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable`](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable/README.md) is the application and reusable-module API
  for work, Flow, schedules, serialization, registration, and clients.
- [`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.Provider`](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.Provider/README.md) is the runtime-provider and
  operator SPI for claims, pumping, health, drain, recovery, and controlled repair.
- [`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql`](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql/README.md) is the first
  authoritative-store implementation. Slices 3–6 supply explicit schema management, Work, Flow, Schedule, and an
  explicitly opted-in hosted runtime.

All three packages participate in the coordinated prerelease publish plan. They remain preview contracts: adopt them
only with the reviewed schema, role, recovery, and operational evidence described below, and do not treat the preview
as production support.

For the internal W3C causal-link contract, safe telemetry attributes, deployment order, and reference proof, read
[Durable Flow trace context v1](flow-trace-context-v1.md). It supplies persistence and crash-proof seams now; it does
not make Slice 4 a hosted runtime.

## Why this boundary

Reusable modules should describe durable intent without selecting storage or starting workers. Runtime providers need
public, testable contracts without friend access to the application package. The dependency therefore points one way:

`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql` → `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.Provider` → `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable`

The application package registers only passive registries. A provider is selected explicitly by the host. The PostgreSQL
provider adds explicit migrations (`0001_work_shared`, `0002_forced_rls`, `0003_flow_protocol`,
`0004_schedule_protocol`, `0005_runtime_heartbeat`, `0006_flow_trace_context`, `0007_flow_retention`,
`0008_flow_repair`, and `0009_work_contract_discovery`) plus one-operation-at-a-time Work, Flow, and Work-first Schedule
persistence with versioned W3C
causal evidence, verified retention, and evidence-first Flow repair. PostgreSQL registration remains passive; an
application explicitly adds one bounded polling host through
[`AddWorkerHost()`](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql/README.md#run-a-worker-host) only where it intends
continuous activation. It adds no public endpoint, dashboard, or automatic migration.

The minimum supported PostgreSQL compatibility floor is PostgreSQL 16 or newer (`server_version_num >= 160000`); CI and default strict proof
use `postgres:16.5@sha256:53f3e608f9475ce120ced2d0f430b89458d7faa28530e0b0977a6af64d294877`.

## Slice 7 discovery and reconciliation

Slice 7 remains a public-preview surface. The documentation below describes its discovery and reconciliation contract;
it does not replace deployment review or confer production support.

Storage registration is passive. The PostgreSQL provider opens no worker and installs no hosted service until the host
explicitly calls [`AddWorkerHost()`](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql/README.md#run-a-worker-host). Startup validates the
stored schema version and active runtime epoch, fails closed on incompatibility, and never applies DDL or silently
advances schema history.

The forward-only deployment order is:

1. `0001_work_shared.sql`
2. `0002_forced_rls.sql`
3. `0003_flow_protocol.sql`
4. `0004_schedule_protocol.sql`
5. `0005_runtime_heartbeat.sql`
6. `0006_flow_trace_context.sql`
7. `0007_flow_retention.sql`
8. `0008_flow_repair.sql`
9. `0009_work_contract_discovery.sql`
10. [`Durable/configure-postgresql-roles.sql`](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/blob/main/Durable/configure-postgresql-roles.sql)

The preferred production flow is to generate and review the Durable schema script offline, drain and stop every pre-`0009`
worker, apply the reviewed migrations in the order above (including `0009_work_contract_discovery.sql`), apply the canonical
role recipe, and run schema status/preflight before enabling the
worker host. The [`durable schema` CLI commands](../Cli/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli/README.md#durable-postgresql-schema-commands)
make those checks discoverable. `apply --apply` is an explicit migration-owner operation only; deployments normally
pass `--connection-env APPSURFACE_DURABLE_MIGRATION_CONNECTION`, and it is never a startup side effect. Offline and
online commands accept no connection-string argument and never print connection strings.

For recovery, inspect status first, produce a corrected and reviewed forward-only script, then retry the intended
operation. Never delete or rewrite migration history. The [`durable-postgresql` example](../examples/durable-postgresql/README.md)
is a local proof of the boundaries above, not production operations guidance.

Typed Work authoring is documented in the [typed Work definition migration guide](migrations/typed-work-definitions-v1.md).
It is a syntax and rollout guide; the existing PostgreSQL workload remains the evidence for acceptance and terminal
completion.

## Scale and transport boundary

PostgreSQL is the first planned authoritative provider, not the definition of AppSurface Durable. The adopter contracts
describe accepted Work, Flow, Schedule, payload, and external-effect semantics without selecting a database, polling
loop, queue, or broker. The Provider SPI likewise describes bounded activation and fenced execution without exposing a
broker acknowledgement as durable truth.

A deployment may evolve in two distinct ways:

- a wake-only broker or notification may activate `IDurableRuntimePump`; the authoritative provider still discovers,
  claims, fences, and completes eligible work, and a periodic pass remains the recovery path for lost notifications;
- a future broker-backed provider may implement the Provider SPI directly when it can preserve the same acceptance,
  revision, execution-identity, provider-effect, schedule, and recovery contracts.

Slice 2 intentionally does not define a targeted broker-dispatch token or general event-bus API. Those shapes require a
concrete broker and deployment need. Queue delivery alone must never authorize execution, prove completion, or replace
the provider's authoritative history.

The preview persists explicit Work and Flow decisions rather than arbitrary `async` stack state. It also makes no
exactly-once claim for external effects. Provider safety, immutable execution identity, revision fences, and versioned
command fingerprints make ambiguity observable and fail closed.

Operational failures use the shared [`ASDURxxx` diagnostics catalog](../troubleshooting/durable-diagnostics.md), including
the fixed hosted-runtime liveness and worker-generation codes.

For the PostgreSQL boundary, start with the [`slice 3 reference workload`](slice3-reference-workload.md), [`slice 4 reference workload`](slice4-reference-workload.md), [`Schedule protocol v1`](schedule-protocol-v1.md), and [Durable Flow trace context v1](flow-trace-context-v1.md), then use the
normative [`Work protocol v1`](work-protocol-v1.md) and [`Flow protocol v1`](flow-protocol-v1.md). The
[`slice 3 reconstruction ledger`](slice3-reconstruction.md) and [`slice 4 reconstruction ledger`](slice4-reconstruction.md) account for every artifact in the superseded branches.

Terminal Flow evidence now has a [verified retention lifecycle](ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Durable.PostgreSql/README.md#verified-flow-retention): a bounded per-Flow assessment, immutable manifest, reproducible archive package, receipt/source correspondence proof, optional hold, and separately authorized idempotent purge. It is intentionally not an age-based deletion feature. The application owns authorization, archive transport, encryption, availability, policy duration, and compliance.

The [slice 2 API budget](api-budget.md) records which original public contracts were retained, moved, added,
internalized, or removed. The package test projects enforce the corresponding member-level API snapshots.
