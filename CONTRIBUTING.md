# Contributing to AppSurface

AppSurface maintains a coordinated release contract. This file explains the contribution rules that feed the public release surface.

## Feedback path

AppSurface treats docs and onboarding feedback as product input, not as a second-class support queue. File issues when a package, example, README, or release note leaves you unable to reproduce the intended path.
For quick access, use GitHub's issue template chooser: [choose an issue template](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/issues/new/choose).

- Use the [**Bug report** issue form](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) when behavior is broken or surprising.
- Use the [**Feature request** issue form](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) when you can name a focused product capability, API shape, workflow, or example that would remove friction.
- Use the [**Docs or developer experience feedback** issue form](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/issues/new?template=docs_feedback.yml) when the code may work, but the route to understanding it is unclear.
- Do not use public issue forms for suspected vulnerabilities, leaked secrets, or exploit details. Use the [security policy](./SECURITY.md) and report sensitive findings privately.
- Include the command, page, example, package, or API where the confusion started. The sharpest reports name the exact step that failed and the next thing you expected to see.
- If you are unsure whether something is a bug, feature request, or docs gap, file the docs/DX form and explain the behavior you expected.

Avoid broad requests such as "improve the docs" without a concrete page, task, or decision point. Narrow feedback is easier to verify and much more likely to turn into a useful change.

## Local setup

Use a current .NET SDK supported by this repository, then restore and build from the repository root before opening a pull request:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

Run the sample or package-specific command you changed, and include that command in your pull request notes. For broad changes, also run the full test suite and coverage command listed in [Local verification](#local-verification).

## Working on docs

Documentation changes should explain both how to use an API and why a reader would choose it. When a docs change touches public behavior, update the package-level README, repository-level entry point, or release note surface that helps someone discover the change.

Good docs pull requests usually include:

- Reference content for API shape, defaults, constraints, and examples.
- Decision guidance that explains when to use the API and when another approach fits better.
- Pitfalls that call out ordering requirements, generated output, hosting assumptions, or common mistakes.
- Verification notes for commands, links, snippets, or examples that were checked.
- For shared package-policy text, follow the [PackageIndex release-guidance maintainer guide](./tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/README.md#release-guidance) instead of hand-copying `## Release Guidance` prose across package READMEs.

## Test fixture path policy

Tests that build a full filesystem path under a repository root, temp workspace, project directory, output directory, or other trusted base should use `TestPathUtils.PathUnder` from `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Testing`. Add a project reference to `tests/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Testing/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Testing.csproj` and a `Using Include="ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Testing"` entry when a test project needs the helper.

Use `PathUnder` for dynamic repo-relative, temp-relative, or output-relative values such as `projectPath`, `relativePath`, and `outputRelativePath`. Use `TestPathUtils.RelativePath` only when the test needs a validated relative string rather than a full filesystem path.

Literal expected paths and tests intentionally exercising `Path.Join` or `Path.Combine` platform behavior may continue to use the BCL APIs directly. If the policy test flags an intentional case, add a reasoned entry to `tests/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Testing/path-policy-allowlist.yml`; entries without reasons or entries that no longer match a violation fail validation.

## Release contract

- AppSurface releases the monorepo in unison. Packages, CLI tooling, examples, and docs-facing behavior all roll into the same next version.
- Pull request titles that land on `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) using release-note-friendly types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, or `revert`. The squash-merge title is the durable signal for future automation and changelog grouping.
- Add a new file under `releases/unreleased.entries/` whenever a pull request changes behavior, usage guidance, release policy, examples, or docs consumers would care about in release notes. See the [append-only release-note guidance](./releases/README.md#append-only-unreleased-entries). Do not edit [`releases/unreleased.md`](./releases/unreleased.md) for an ordinary feature pull request; CI rejects that shared-template edit unless the pull request is release preparation or is itself updating the release-contract policy. [AppSurface Docs](./Web/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Docs/README.md) and [release preparation](./tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Release/README.md#append-only-unreleased-entries) compose the stable template.
- Name the file `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`, start it with an exact directive such as `<!-- appsurface:unreleased-entry section="included" -->`, then write the Markdown entry. The section value must be `taking-shape`, `included`, or `migration-watch`. The composer sorts filenames and inserts each entry at the bottom of its declared section, after that section's placeholder bullet. Add a new file for corrections instead of changing another pull request's entry; release preparation archives and removes only the entries it consumed and records their paths in the evidence-digested release manifest.
- Maintainers may apply the `no-unreleased-entry` label only for changes that do not belong in the public release story, such as repo administration or workflow-only cleanup.

## Writing documentation

- Link named concepts to their canonical documentation instead of only mentioning them. When prose names a package, guide, example, workflow, policy, diagnostic family, CLI command, or cross-package concept, add a nearby link to the best start-here or reference page unless the same paragraph already defines it completely.
- Prefer useful cross-links over link noise. Link the first meaningful mention in a section, and link again only when the reader is likely to need the destination without scrolling back.
- Use links to connect concepts, not just files. For example, a release note that mentions [PWA install support](./Web/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Web/Docs/pwa-install.md) should link to the Web package PWA guide and [PWA example](./examples/web-pwa-install/README.md); a note that mentions [RazorWire auth projection](./Web/ForgeTrust.RazorWire.Auth.AspNetCore/README.md) should link to the RazorWire auth package README or [auth proof example](./examples/auth-web-razorwire-proof/README.md).
- Keep link targets durable. Prefer package READMEs, guides, examples, release notes, and public docs routes over transient PRs, local scratch notes, or maintainer-only recovery material.

## Writing release notes

- Start from the public [release hub](./releases/README.md).
- Keep [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) compact. It is the ledger, not the full story.
- Put detailed adoption notes in the current unreleased page or a tagged release page under [`releases/`](./releases/README.md).
- Capture breaking or behavior-changing updates in the unreleased page even before `v0.1.0`. Finalized migration guidance moves into the tagged release page when the version ships.
- Write for package consumers before maintainers. Start each notable entry with the adopter outcome, the package or app shape it applies to, and the next action a reader can take.
- Link every substantial feature, named concept, workflow, diagnostic family, or package boundary to its best start-here material, such as the package README, guide, example, or CLI proof. Do not leave readers to search the repository after a release note names a capability.
- Define internal phrases in plain language before using them as labels. Prefer "[RazorWire can render allowed, forbidden, and anonymous UI from your existing ASP.NET Core policies](./Web/ForgeTrust.RazorWire.Auth.AspNetCore/README.md)" over opaque shorthand such as "passive auth projection" by itself.
- Keep maintainer evidence, warning IDs, diagnostics, and generated-artifact details after the consumer path unless those details change adoption risk.

## Maintainer workflow

- Use the [release authoring checklist](./releases/release-authoring-checklist.md) when preparing a release.
- Use the [PackageIndex maintainer guide](./tools/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.PackageIndex/README.md) when package manifest, generated chooser, readiness, or README release-guidance policy changes.
- Use the [tagged release template](./releases/templates/tagged-release-template.md) when cutting the first versioned release note.
- Keep private maintainer-only recovery notes outside harvested public docs. In this repository, `.github/` is the safe home for that material.

## Local verification

Build and test the full solution before pushing substantive changes:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test --no-build
./scripts/coverage-solution.sh
```

The default script runs both merged coverage and the repository thresholds. It compares local patch
coverage with `origin/main`; set `COVERAGE_GATE_DIFF_BASE=` when only aggregate coverage is wanted.
It deliberately accepts no project-selection, filter, output, or merge arguments. Use the public
[`appsurface coverage` commands](./Cli/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli/README.md#appsurface-coverage-run)
when a contributor needs a focused run or a shard merge.

### CI test-result diagnostics

The GitHub Actions full-solution coverage lane publishes a bounded, failure-first test summary from
the AppSurface-managed JUnit output. The CLI owns this report alongside its slow-test diagnostics:
it names failed projects and test cases, includes safely truncated failure detail, and never exceeds
the GitHub step-summary limit. This summary deliberately replaces the per-project GitHub Actions
test logger in the broad coverage lane, which can exceed that limit as the suite grows. Download the
`test-result-diagnostics` artifact for the complete JUnit XML and per-project `dotnet test` logs,
especially for fork pull requests where [Codecov test-result reporting](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/test-analytics)
is unavailable without a repository token.

The coverage run treats missing or malformed JUnit evidence as a diagnostics warning, never as a
replacement failure for the original test result; use the artifact and the coverage-step log to
diagnose that condition.

The wrapper requires a non-sandboxed host by default and fails before discovery, cleanup, build,
or tests when an explicit sandbox marker is enabled. Set `COVERAGE_REQUIRE_NON_SANDBOX=false` only
when a restricted run is intentional. The check does not classify generic CI or container hosts as sandboxes; see the
[non-sandboxed runner reference](./Cli/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli/README.md#require-a-non-sandboxed-runner).

When `COVERAGE_GATE_DIFF_BASE` selects a patch comparison, the gate also writes
`TestResults/coverage-merged/coverage-patch-targets.json` and
`TestResults/coverage-merged/coverage-patch-targets.md`, even without patch thresholds. Read the
brief, open each `path:line`, identify the relevant test project, run
`dotnet test <project> --no-restore`, then run the full coverage lane and one final full gate.
An empty active queue means the patch is fully covered for the selected gate semantics. Clearing
`COVERAGE_GATE_DIFF_BASE` intentionally runs a nonpatch gate and removes those two target files.
The output stays untracked through the existing `TestResults` ignore rule; do not add target
filenames to `.gitignore`. See the [CLI target-artifact guidance](./Cli/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Cli/README.md#agent-actionable-patch-targets)
for `--no-clean`, `ASCOV019`, and optional retention in an existing CI artifact upload.
