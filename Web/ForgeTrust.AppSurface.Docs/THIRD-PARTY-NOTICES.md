# Third-Party Notices

ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Docs includes the following third-party components in addition to the repository license.

## Acornima

- Package: `Acornima`
- Version: `1.6.2`
- License: BSD-3-Clause
- Project: https://github.com/adams85/acornima

Acornima is used by AppSurface Docs to parse configured JavaScript source files for public API documentation. The package is redistributed under the BSD-3-Clause license terms supplied by Acornima and its contributors.

No endorsement is implied by AppSurface or AppSurface Docs release notes, marketing copy, package metadata, or generated documentation.

## TreeSitter.DotNet

- Package: `TreeSitter.DotNet`
- Version: `1.3.0`
- License declaration: MIT
- Project: https://github.com/mariusgreuel/tree-sitter-dotnet-bindings
- Pinned source revision: `8cae484bc033dac6e492ed15166877f3d784850f`

TreeSitter.DotNet provides the static parser binding and bundled native grammar assets used by the opt-in Python
docstring harvester. AppSurface Docs initializes the Python grammar only to parse policy-approved source text; it never
imports or executes Python modules. The selected nupkg bundles multiple language grammars and native runtime assets, so
updating this dependency requires the archive/RID and redistribution-notice review described in the
[candidate record](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/blob/main/Web/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Docs.Tests/TestData/PythonParserDecision/README.md).

## MiniSearch

- Package: `minisearch`
- Version: `7.2.0`
- License: MIT
- Project: https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/
- Source package path: `Web/node_modules/minisearch/dist/umd/index.js`
- Generated asset path: `Web/ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Docs/wwwroot/docs/minisearch.min.js`

MiniSearch provides the real browser search runtime used by the built-in AppSurface Docs search UI. The repository pins the package in `Web/package.json` and `Web/pnpm-lock.yaml`; `pnpm --dir Web run assets:build` minifies the official distributed UMD browser bundle into the committed package asset path.

To update MiniSearch, change the pinned `minisearch` version in `Web/package.json`, run `pnpm --dir Web install`, run `pnpm --dir Web run assets:build`, verify this notice still names the correct package version, source path, and license, then run `pnpm --dir Web run assets:verify`.

Do not replace this asset with a CDN URL. AppSurface Docs search must continue to work in offline static exports and package-embedded hosts.
